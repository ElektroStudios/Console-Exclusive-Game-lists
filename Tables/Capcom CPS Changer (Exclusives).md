    - We use a filter to arbitrarily include and exclude platform exclusive content:

      
    |Included:|Excluded:|
    |:--|:--|
    |Released Games|Cancelled or Not Yet Released Games


 - The items in the table are ordered alphabetically by Title column. If you need to sort items in another column, you may search for custom Markdown plugins / user-scripts or convert this table to a more suitable format, such as CSV or HTML with JavaScript.

 - The cell entries are made up of useful hyperlinks pointing to the game entry, release date information and genre categories from Gamefaqs website.
