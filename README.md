The intention of this repository is to serve as a point of reference, with the following lists provided to easily identify which games were released exclusively for a specific platform. 

Each list contains several tables in Markdown format: one table for exclusive games and other tables for compilations and multi-platform games released on that platform.

This repository would not be possible without the existence of the Gamefaqs website and its video game database (Thank you very much for your work!).
